## Proxies & VPNs
First of all, let's talk about VPNs. They are very effective at hiding your IP address from servers, but they are run by private companies and even though they claim to have a "No log" policy, they can record your activity to sell personal information or give it to law enforcement, so you can't trust them 100%.

Proxies are a very good option, but it's the same thing, companies can record your activity.
However, you can create your own VPN or proxy server by yourself or use those administered by individuals.

## Tor browser
Tor is a very good browser, you need to use it every time you want a private browsing and you can access to .onion domains, but use it with a VPN and a Proxy, some Tor exit nodes (servers that make tor work) are under the supervision of the law enforcements. Don't use it for every day life because it is very slow.

## Digital identity
First, don't use your real identity and personal email address. Whenever a website asks you for personal information, use a fake identity and several different email addresses.

Use randomly generated passwords, you can store them on LastPass with 2FA.
